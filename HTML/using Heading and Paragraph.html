      <h2>HTML: The Structure of the Web</h2>
      <p>
          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of every website. It provides the basic structure of pages, which is then enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. HTML uses a system of tags to define different elements on a page, from headings and paragraphs to links and images.

      <h3>CSS: Styling the Web</h3>
      <p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what makes websites visually appealing. While HTML provides the structure, CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual presentation. With CSS, developers can create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

      <h4>JavaScript: Bringing Interactivity</h4>
      <p>
          JavaScript is the programming language that makes web pages dynamic. It allows for interactive elements like forms, animations, and real-time updates without requiring page reloads. Modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular have revolutionized how we build web applications.
